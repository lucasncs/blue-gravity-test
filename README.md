# Inventory & Shop interaction test
### The guidelines for this task were:

- Include a player character capable of walking and interacting with the game world.
- Design a suitable UI for this prototype.
- You may use pre-made art assets or create your own for this task.
- Project must be developed using Unity 2021.3.2f1.
- Please ensure that the prototype is designed in 2D, as 3D designs and prototypes are not relevant to this particular task.
- Please provide 300-word documentation explaining the system, your thought process, and decisions during the development.
- This assignment should be completed within 48 hours of receiving these instructions.
